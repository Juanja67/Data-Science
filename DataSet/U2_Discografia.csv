Boy;1980;I Will Follow;"I will follow
I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see
A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found
Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give me
Your, your, your eyes
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

Boy;1980;Twilight;"I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry
My body grows and grows
It frightens me you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known
Twilight...
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way
In the shadow boy meets man

Boy;1980;Out Of Control;"Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
Say how long
It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad
I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control
Boys and girls to school
And girls they make children
Not like this one
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood
One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate
I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control";0

Boy;1980;A Day Without Me;"Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind

Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?

Boy;1980;Shadows And Tall Trees;"Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same
Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees

But I know, oh no
But I know

Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
Is love like a tightrope
Hanging on my ceiling?

It's in the things that I do and say
And if I wanna live I gotta die to myself someday

With John Coltrane and a love supreme
And in the next room I hear a woman scream out
Her lover's turning off, turning on the television
And I can't tell the difference between ABC News, Hill Street Blues, and a preacher on the Old Time Gospel Hour
Stealing money from the sick and the old
Well, the God I believe in isn't short of cash, mister
I feel a long way from the hills of San Salvador
Where the sky is ripped open and the rain pours
Through a gaping wound, pelting the women and children
Pelting the women and children
Run, run
Into the arms of America";1

A highway with no-one on it

A river in a time of dryness

To last with me through the night

We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine

You were talking about the end of the world
I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world
In my dream, I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy

Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug
Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules
Oh, love, sweetheart, you're so cruel
She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing, her movements something else

Because when he hurts you, you feel alive

You could lip-sync to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere:
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin
And, if you listen, I can't call
And, if you jump, you just might fall
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be enough

I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it
I went out riding down that old eight-lane
I passed by a thousand signs looking for my own name
I went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon
Yeah, I went out for the papers, told her I'd be back by noon

To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

At the ATM machine

A face staring back at me

The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul that's real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship once it's won
It's won... it's one
Northside just across the river to the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road
Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
'Cause it's never dead it's still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I'm still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can't see
You can... you can
Northside just across the river from the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road
If the door is open it isn't theft
You can't return to where you've never left
Blossoms falling from a tree
They cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place we can call home

Songs Of Experience;2017;The Showman (Little More Better);"Baby's crying cause it's born to sing
Singers cry about everything
Still in the playground falling off a swing

Walk through the room like a birthday cake
When I am all lit up, I can't make a mistake
And there's a level of shallow that you just can't fake
But you know that I know

This screwed up stuff is the stuff of dreams
I got just enough low self esteem
To get me where I want to go
The showman gives you front row to his heart
The showman prays his heartache will chart
Making a spectacle of falling apart
Is just the start of the show

A little more better

Songs Of Experience;2017;The Little Things That Give You Away;"The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
There's something wrong there
Oh la la, I'm not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me
It's the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
I saw you on the stairs
You didn't notice I was there
That's 'cause you were talking at me
And not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty
It's the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It's the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey?
It's the little things
The little things that give you away
Sometimes
I can't believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I can't get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It's not coming
The end is here
Sometimes

Every soul that left me
Every heart that kept me
The strangers that protected me
To bring me back to you

Every false emotion
How unswerving our devotion
To the lies we know are almost true
Every sweet confusion
Every grand illusion

That is the contract of the heart

They said there'll be peace on Earth

A veil of tears for the virgin birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And eyes full of tinsel and fire
They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise
I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year

When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near

That comes in the night
It repeats and it shouts in my ear

You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Cruelly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
I look inside myself
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I wanna paint it black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me

The kind that science can't explain
The man you carry in your heart
Is only comfortable when he's in pain
Are you a stranger in your own life?
What are you hiding behind those eyes?
Can anyone find you there?
Or just me?
You know your song saved my life
I don't sing it just so I can get by
Won't you hear me when I tell you, darling
I sing it to survive
Your song saved my life
The worst and the best days of my life
I was broken, now I'm open, your love keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
Your song saved my life
The worst and the best days of my life
Your song saved my life
Song saved my
Song saved my
Your song saved my life
Your song got me through tonight
Your song saved my life
Song saved my
Song saved my life";1
